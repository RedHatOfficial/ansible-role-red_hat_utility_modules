# ansible-role-red_hat_utility_modules
An Ansible role that contains re-useable miscellaneous utility modules for various Red Hat tools and products.

These are modules that are not currently shipped with Ansible but others may find useful. They are distributed in a role for easier consumption so the user does not need to copy paste the module files into their own repositories and rather can do a dynamic role requirment to pull in these modules.
